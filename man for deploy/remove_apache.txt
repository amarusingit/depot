1. First, stop apache2
$ sudo service apache2 stop

2. Uninstall Apache2 and its dependent packages
$ sudo apt-get purge apache2 apache2-utils apache2.2-bin apache2-common

3. Also use autoremove option to get rid of other dependencies
$ sudo apt-get autoremove

4. Check whether there are any configuration files have not been removed
$ whereis apache2

If you get a response as follows apache2: /etc/apache2

5. Remove the directory and existing configuration files
$ sudo rm -rf /etc/apache2
